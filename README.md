## Overview and Origin

**Flinks Technology Inc.**, is a subsidiary of National Bank of Canada (85.9% shareholder). Founded in 2016 in Montreal, QC. by Yves-Gabriel Leboeuf; Founder & CEO, Julien Cousineau; Founder & CTO and Frederick Lavoie; Co-Founder & COO. Flinks first launched in April 2017 as a solution for FinTech companies to securely connect their apps with customers’ bank accounts, verify account balances, and access transaction histories. The startup later expanded beyond these capabilities to find useful insights with data. Flinks works with businesses in the lending, investment, and banking sectors. User-authorized data ensures financial institutions and FinTech companies can meet their compliance requirements and minimize business risk. Flinks raised capital multiple times in seed rounds and most recently Series B funding rounds. Total funding raised to date is approximately 120 million CAD which includes the last series B investment when National Bank of Canada purchased a majority ownership stake for $100 million on 26 April 2021.

## Business Activities:

Flinks enables businesses to connect to their customers' financial accounts, enrich this data, and utilize it to deliver better digital products. Flinks will create, customize, and host the data. No code or developer needed to access the customers’ financial data. Instant Digital KYC: Retrieve critical KYC data, allowing the verification of customers’ identity and/or account information. Onboard customers with seamless ID verification and Anti-Money Laundering processes.

Flinks intended consumers are Fintech companies. For example, digital lenders can benefit from the instant access to customer banking transaction history for the purpose of automatically analyzing borrowers financial health and ensuring underwriting standards are upheld. Realtime monitoring of counterparty risk can be achieved. Similar efficiencies will positively impact  the digital mortgage lending sector, buy-now pay-later lending, SMB lending, auto financing. 

Online forum chatter between developers indicates Flinks provides more reliable data connections to Canadian Bank accounts when compared to its direct competitor, an American based company.

For security reasons, there is very little information publicly available regarding the secure data transfer methods Flinks employs to retrieve the data.

## Landscape:

Flinks is a Financial Data Provider. Big Data processing and maching learning require large sets of data to provide valuable insights. The more data an organization has, the better its decisions will be. Over the last 5-10 years, increasing access to consumer financial data has increased the personolization applied to financial products. This is a growing trend that will continue in the future. Plaid.com is the major competitor to Flinks.

## Results

The biggest impact so far is the breakthrough in Open Banking that Flinks has provided to Candian financial institutions and their customers. Up until very recently, Canadian consumers did not have ownership of their financial data. Some of the metrics companies in this domain might use to measure success might include the total number of banks integrated on the platform, consistency and quality of the data provided to the customer. Flinks is very much the challenger to the incumbant Plaid.com. Though its performance metrics in Canada are most likely better than the competition, it's presence in the United-States is much smaller than the competition.

## Recommendations

In order to differentiate itself from the competition, I would recommend that in the future, Flinks Technology inc. focus it's research and development efforts into a blockchain verified data product similar to a credit score, but which relies on an individuals financial transaction history and account balances to prove credit worthiness. This value add product is the next natural evolution for comapnies product offering. 

Currently, lenders are paying for the ability to use the financial date of borrowers to improve lending decisions. The blockchain credit score could provide a suitable solution for the majority of simple lending products.
